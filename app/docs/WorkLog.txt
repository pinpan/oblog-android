TODO:
1. Fragment.getViewModelFactory() creates new ViewModelFactory on app start and then every time TppList loading is invoked
Thie in turn triggers creation of new repository. Question is:
   - Do we have to create new Factory every time?
   - Can't we cash the Tpp repository? Where?

2. Create /Enhance:
   New layourt:
    - Search page / fragment
    - Front page
      - consider tabed layout or combo box for :  {Followed, EBA, Past viewed}
      - buttons for opening the respective page
    - Demo flow

    - TPP Detail
  - Site branding and styling
     - Logo, Slogan
     - Colors palette, icon
